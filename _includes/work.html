			<h2>Baseline Methodologies tried along with the datasets used:</h2> 

			<h3>Datasets used:</h3>
			<p>We scraped instagram pages via users and hashtags for posts, comments and number of likes per post.  We chose our users based on how relevant and rich their content was in order to train our model better.  We chose the hashtags to scrape based on how popular they were by analysing how often they were used. We also tried to scrape a large category of topics in order to get a wider range of topics to train on. Some categories include sports, news, fashion, art, nature, style, food, animals, travel etc. We currently have a total of 16558 user based posts and 10335 tag based posts..</p>

			<h3>Methodologies tried:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>The State-of-the-art model uses Sequence 2 Sequence with Bi-attention mechanism network which takes posts as well as conversations as data and its corresponding hashtags as true label.</li>
				<li>We have also referred other networks such as mentioned in  Topic-Aware Neural Keyphrase Generation for Social Media Language which include unsupervised LDA Topic modeling. However since training LDA performed poorly with small datasets, we decided to go with the Supervised model.</li>
				<li>We also found that LDA performance is poor in comparison to the existing model according to the evaluation matrix provided in the papers (links to the papers were provided in the Scope Document)</li>
