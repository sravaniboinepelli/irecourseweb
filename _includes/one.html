		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<ol>
		<li>Instagram has more number of hashtags and  longer post length than twitter and Weibo.</li>
		<li>User based scraping is very slow because of the limit for GQL queries. For users > 500 posts we encountered many blocking delays as well.</li>
		<li>Data scarcity on Instagram: Posts have minimal text which does not help provide any context. Image, post and hashtag have nearly no correlation. </li> 
		<li>Context and likes generated tags are two separate categories and evaluating two separate metrics in one go is not viable. We  assign a higher priority to the context while ranking popularity. </li>
		<li>We tried clustering and categorizing the generated hashtags to further incorporate ranking by doing topic modelling as well but training the LDA performed poorly as most of the words were named entities and the size of the post was less resulting in bad accuracy.</li>
		<li>For incorporating likes into the model, we need a dataset that captures the distinction/popularity between two different hashtags given that the context of the post is the same. Eg: <br>
    Post1 : The theme for Felicity is Superheroes #FestofIIITH <br>
    Post2 : The theme for Felicity is Superheroes #FunatIIITH <br>
    
    As per our knowledge, there is no such available data source to scrape from that would capture this phenomenon and hence, ranking based on this idea is not possible.
